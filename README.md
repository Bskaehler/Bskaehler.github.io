# About Me
## My Interests
Music has always been a huge part of my life. About a year ago I got back into playing guitar. With a few friends I'm working on making some music. We don't have anything concrete yet, but we hope to have something soon. I typically enjoy rock and metal. Some of my favorite bands are Iron Maiden, Rush, and Mastodon. 

I also collect comic books. Mainly superheroes, but I do read other genres as well. I've managed to find a decent number of older comics from the 70's and 80's and really interesting to see how comics have changed since then. 

## Websites I Recommend
 - [Guitar Center](https://www.Guitarcenter.com) - This is generally where I go to get all of my gear for making music. 
 - [League of Comic Geeks](https://www.leagueofcomicgeeks.com) - I've been collecting comic books for a few years now and it's easy to get overwhelmed with how many different books are out there. This website has been a valuable resource in keeping track of what I have and what I'm looking for.
