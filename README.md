# About Me
## My Interests
## Websites I Recommend
 - [Guitar Center](https://www.Guitarcenter.com) - This is generally where I go to get all of my gear for making music. 
 - [League of Comic Geeks](https://www.leagueofcomicgeeks.com) - I've been collecting comic books for a few years now and it's easy to get overwhelmed with how many different books are out there. This website has been a valuable resource in keeping track of what I have and what I'm looking for.
